# How commit?
 First you have to chose which files you want to add to commit. In order to do this use commend
 ````
 git add
 ````
Then you can commit. It is important to add also some comment at least in my case I cannot even cmmit without it.
````
git commit -m "Comment"
````
And the last step is to push your work. This could be done by
````
git pull
git push
````
Second important thing is that in the very begining you should point where you want import your files. This you can do by
````
gir remote add origin https://github.com/krystianjablonowski/HK_MB.git 
````
More about ``git remote`` one can read [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote).
For the begining this is all what you should know.
